Good Morning
Jer Thorp

I was drawn to "Good Morning," created by Jer Thorp, the current Data Artist in Residence at the New York Times, because I love how a seemingly simple idea - visualizing 11,000 'good morning' tweets from around the world - manifests in such a beautiful way and sends a positive message. After a five-day data collection process, Thorp ended up with a JSON file of 50,000 tweets, users, dates, and locations for a day's worth of "Good Morning" tweets. Thorp color-coded the tweets using green, orange, red, and black. I find these color choices visually appealing and, in combination with the bouncing movement, they give me a sense of energy. Every time I watch this piece, I feel awake and energized, which fits perfectly with the underlying concept of saying "Good Morning." I also like that he chose to place the blocks of color on a black and white Earth because it makes them pop and ensures that the moving blocks are the central focus of the piece.  I find it interesting that, on his blog, Thorp says, "I'll admit that this isn't a particularly useful visualization," because I think the overall idea behind the piece is incredibly useful. I think it is a good reminder that when we wake up and start our days every morning, we're not alone. In a similar vein, it also serves as a reminder that, despite our differences in the world, we all start the day by saying "Good Morning" to each other. I think that Thorp's piece speaks to finding common experiences, even if they're simple and we don't think about them all the time. Overall, I love the liveliness of Thorp's vibrant piece - the experience of watching it in and of itself is a great way to give yourself the energy you need to start the day.

Chromogram
Martin Wattenberg, Fernanda B. Viégas, and Kate Hollenbach

I was drawn to "Chromogram," created by Martin Wattenberg, Fernanda B. Viégas, and Kate Hollenbach, because it creates aesthetically pleasing images while, simultaneously, revealing interesting data patterns that warrant further analysis. "Chromogram" was created to study how Wikipedia participants use their time. It uses the first three letters of strings to determine the color in the Chromogram - the first determining color, the second determining saturation, and the third determining brightness. Chromogram successfully sheds light on how Wikipedia participants systematically make edits. It shows that, while some users dedicate their time to a particular topic, others choose to focus on one task that involves editing many different articles, such as alphabetizing or reorganizing (the former is shown in the second image above and the latter is shown in the third image above). By finding this pattern, Chromogram has opened up two interesting areas for future research: 1) qualitatively assessing how Wikipedia editors spend their time and 2) comparing the patterns that editors engage in based on their experience levels. I find "Chromogram" fascinating because it shows the intersection between data visualization in the field of new media art and data visualization in the more traditional sense of academic research and analysis. I also think that this study's findings and the way in which they reveal avenues for future research demonstrate that this type of data visualization could be useful to many other fields. The patterns that it reveals can help ensure that we are asking the right research questions.

Travel Visa Inequalities 
Christian Laesser

I was drawn to "Travel Visa Inequalities," created by Christian Laesser, because I love how the idea came from Laesser's personal experience. Laesser got the idea for this visualization from a trip that he took to Thailand. He realized that, while he didn't need a visa to travel to Thailand from Germany, a person from Thailand needs a visa to visit Germany. Laesser's analysis and visualization of the visa travel policies of 194 countries reveals the extent of travel visa inequality. He also ranked every country he studied by their "inequality score," which is simply their advantages minus their disadvantages. While people from the United States enjoy visa advantages in the majority of countries (ranked #1 out of 194), only 7.7% of other countries treat Haiti as an equal (ranked #194 out of 194). I find it fascinating to play around with Laesser's creation because it shows just how big of a difference the country you live in makes for your ability to travel. Laesser also builds in many different ways for the user to interact with his data visualization. It starts by laying out a narrative and asking: Where can Germans travel to? Who is allowed to travel to Germany? It then displays a map of the world, and users can rollover each country to see how many travel advantages and how many travel disadvantages are associated with that country. Users can also click on countries to see in which other countries they are awarded an advantage and in which other countries they face disadvantages. Before I stumbled upon Laesser's piece, I had no idea that this inequality existed. Laesser's piece brings attention to a widely ignored issue. The many ways that users can interact with his piece ensure that anyone who comes across it will learn something new.
